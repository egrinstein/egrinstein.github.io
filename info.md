Welcome,

My name is Eric Grinstein. I have recently finished a 6 year dual degree programme between Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and IMT-Atlantique (A Grande École in France). I have obtained a Bacharel of Computer Engineering degree from the former and a Master of Engineering (Diplôme d'Ingénieur Généraliste) degree from the latter.
