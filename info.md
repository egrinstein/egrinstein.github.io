Welcome,

My name is Eric Grinstein and I am a computer engineer from Brazil. I have spent almost 2.5 years in France, with a summer in the Netherlands in between. I love playing the guitar and I love music. In particular, I cannot stop listening to Mark Knopfler since I was 15.

I have created a highly upvoted, downloaded and exploited [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/egrinstein/20-years-of-games) on Kaggle.

I have a conference [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11385) on the very novel topic of "Audio Style Transfer" at ICASSP.

I keep my public software engineering projects at [GitHub](https://github.com/egrinstein).

You can view my detailed work history, as well as my technical skills at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/egrinstein). You can also see my technical skills there.

My e-mail is [eric.grinstein@outlook.com](mailto:eric.grinstein@outlook.com).

You can see my paintings on Instagram through my handle [@grinstegram](https://www.instagram.com/grinstegram/).
