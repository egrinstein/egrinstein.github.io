A random movie plot generator using 4200 movie summaries from imdb. It uses Markov Chains.

This was a little pet project to sharpen my Django and my Heroku skills, and play with Markov Chains in the process. 



<div>
<code id="plotgen">Loading...</code>
<button id="plotgen" type="button">New plot</button>
</div>

Since I migrated to a different layout, the button does not work anymore. You can view the result directly through [here](http://plot-generator.herokuapp.com/).
